There's an audible sigh as Nidmanuru clings on, and that is that for Gill today. Fantastic catch, leaping to take it with both hands above his head right on the rope, then holding his balance until certain he won't topple back. Netherlands finally have the breakthrough. 100/1 Previous NextSee all photosRoelof van der Merwe1005315.3027410028.4 to V Kohli, No number 50 for Kohli here. Van der Merwe has Kohli castled. Flatter angling into the batter. Doesn't turn, just skids on. Kohli stays back, looking to slap it hard. Misses and the ball crashes into off stump. Van der Merwe is pumped up and why not.. 200/3See all photosBas de Leede1008228.2022828017.4 to RG Sharma, Straight to wide long-on. Rohit falls and Netherlands continue to chip away. Hustling back of a length ball on the off stump. Rohit goes for a pull but is sort of rushed into the shot. Gets it high on the bat as the ball goes to Barresi, who ain't dropping those.. 129/249.5 to KL Rahul, picks out deep square leg! De Leede gets one more wicket of a very solid World Cup, but it's too late to limit the damage for Netherlands. Rahul got hold of the pull but there wasn't quite enough on it and Engelbrecht settled under the catch. 408/4 Previous NextSee all photosNetherlands  (T: 411 runs from 50 ovs)BATTING RBM4s6sSRWesley Barresi c †Rahul b Mohammed Siraj4580080.00Max O'Dowd  b Jadeja3042683171.42Colin Ackermann lbw b Kuldeep Yadav35324660109.37Sybrand Engelbrecht  b Mohammed Siraj4580874056.25Scott Edwards (c)†c †Rahul b Kohli1730271056.66Bas de Leede  b Bumrah1221231057.14Teja Nidamanuru c Mohammed Shami b Sharma54396516138.46Logan van Beek  b Kuldeep Yadav16152020106.66Roelof van der Merwe c Mohammed Shami b Jadeja168512200.00Aryan Dutt  b Bumrah51190045.45Paul van Meekeren not out 3470075.00Extras(lb 9, w 4)13TOTAL47.5 Ov (RR: 5.22)250Fall of wickets: 1-5 (Wesley Barresi, 1.3 ov), 2-66 (Colin Ackermann, 12.1 ov), 3-72 (Max O'Dowd, 15.1 ov), 4-111 (Scott Edwards, 24.3 ov), 5-144 (Bas de Leede, 31.6 ov), 6-172 (Sybrand Engelbrecht, 37.3 ov), 7-208 (Logan van Beek, 42.1 ov), 8-225 (Roelof van der Merwe, 43.4 ov), 9-236 (Aryan Dutt, 46.1 ov), 10-250 (Teja Nidamanuru, 47.5 ov) • DRSBOWLINGOMRWECON0s4s6sWDNBJasprit Bumrah913323.6635301031.6 to BFW de Leede, takes the fielders out of the equation! Pinpoint yorker, hits the base of off stump. De Leede is gone in a puff of smoke as Bumrah smuggles one through him. India closing in (sort of, in their own time). 144/546.1 to A Dutt, Does Dutt with a slower ball! He did not have much of a clue, did he. Slower length ball that grips on the surface and spins back in. Dutt eyes a wild slog across the line. Misses and sees his bails flying.. 236/9See all photosMohammed Siraj612924.832350101.3 to W Barresi, Edged and taken is it? Rahul is convinced he has the gloves under the ball. Was an away-swinging length ball outside off. Baressi goes for an expansive cover-drive, but does not move his feet at all. Gets a thin outside edge, and Rahul moves nicely across to his right and completes a very good catch low down. The third umpire is called for, and the catch is clean.. 5/137.3 to SA Engelbrecht, Cleans him up! Searing 138.7kph full-length ball that strikes Engelbrecht on the pads and deflects back onto the stumps. Engelbrecht's vigil ends on 45. Something for Siraj to smile about.. 172/6See all photosMohammed Shami604106.83154110Kuldeep Yadav1014124.1039130012.1 to CN Ackermann, Appeal for lbw and the umpire's finger has gone up in a jiffy.  That looked plumb on first viewing. Ackermann has taken the review, though. Was the leg break on off and middle. He bends low for a sweep, misses it caught bang in front of the stumps. Replays suggest the ball would have crashed into off pole. Success almost right away for Kuldeep.. 66/242.1 to LV van Beek, That's that! Leg break on the stumps and was bowled fuller.

Flatter trajectory on a length on middle stump. O'Dowd stays back and plays all around it. The ball lands and turns past him to rattle his off pole.. 72/343.4 to RE van der Merwe, Another one? Nope, Shami gobbles up the catch at long-on and van der Merwe's sprightly knock ends. He bowled that a touch slower and fuller outside off. The batter looks to go over long-on, but does not get under it. Slams it straight to Shami who is right on the ropes.. 225/8See all photosVirat Kohli301314.3310100024.3 to SA Edwards, KOHLI'S GOT A WICKET! Tickled down the leg side!

There's an audible sigh as Nidmanuru clings on, and that is that for Gill today. Fantastic catch, leaping to take it with both hands above his head right on the rope, then holding his balance until certain he won't topple back. Netherlands finally have the breakthrough. 100/1 Previous NextSee all photosRoelof van der Merwe1005315.3027410028.4 to V Kohli, No number 50 for Kohli here. Van der Merwe has Kohli castled. Flatter angling into the batter. Doesn't turn, just skids on. Kohli stays back, looking to slap it hard. Misses and the ball crashes into off stump. Van der Merwe is pumped up and why not.. 200/3See all photosBas de Leede1008228.2022828017.4 to RG Sharma, Straight to wide long-on. Rohit falls and Netherlands continue to chip away. Hustling back of a length ball on the off stump. Rohit goes for a pull but is sort of rushed into the shot. Gets it high on the bat as the ball goes to Barresi, who ain't dropping those.. 129/249.5 to KL Rahul, picks out deep square leg! De Leede gets one more wicket of a very solid World Cup, but it's too late to limit the damage for Netherlands.

Pinpoint yorker, hits the base of off stump. De Leede is gone in a puff of smoke as Bumrah smuggles one through him. India closing in (sort of, in their own time). 144/546.1 to A Dutt, Does Dutt with a slower ball! He did not have much of a clue, did he. Slower length ball that grips on the surface and spins back in. Dutt eyes a wild slog across the line. Misses and sees his bails flying.. 236/9See all photosMohammed Siraj612924.832350101.3 to W Barresi, Edged and taken is it? Rahul is convinced he has the gloves under the ball. Was an away-swinging length ball outside off. Baressi goes for an expansive cover-drive, but does not move his feet at all. Gets a thin outside edge, and Rahul moves nicely across to his right and completes a very good catch low down. The third umpire is called for, and the catch is clean.. 5/137.3 to SA Engelbrecht, Cleans him up! Searing 138.7kph full-length ball that strikes Engelbrecht on the pads and deflects back onto the stumps. Engelbrecht's vigil ends on 45.

That looked plumb on first viewing. Ackermann has taken the review, though. Was the leg break on off and middle. He bends low for a sweep, misses it caught bang in front of the stumps. Replays suggest the ball would have crashed into off pole. Success almost right away for Kuldeep.. 66/242.1 to LV van Beek, That's that! Leg break on the stumps and was bowled fuller.

win took them level with India on ten points at the top of the table, but ahead on net run rateFirdose Moonda27-Oct-20231:18Urooj: Rizwan was a massive letdown against South AfricaSouth Africa 271 for 9 (Markram 91, Afridi 3-45) beat Pakistan 270 (Shakeel 52, Babar 50, Shamsi 4-60, Jansen 3-43) by one wicketAs Keshav Maharaj exploded into celebration, having swung Mohammad Nawaz to the fine-leg boundary for the winning runs with the No. 11 for company, waves of relief and elation washed over his team-mates watching from the dressing room. South Africa had thrown off the yoke of the choke by the barest of margins against Pakistan in Chennai to chase successfully for the first time in their World Cup 2023 campaign.The one-wicket win took them level with India on ten points at the top of the table, but ahead on net run rate, though they have played an extra game.The victory was set up by their bowlers - Tabraiz Shamsi and Marco Jansen in particular - who dismissed Pakistan for 270 in 46.4 overs despite them having been well placed at 225 for 5 in the 40th. And when Aiden Markram - who overtook Virat Kohli to become the second-highest run scorer of this World Cup during his innings of 91 - and David Miller were putting together their 70-run stand for the fifth wicket, a South African win looked comfortable. All that changed when Miller edged Shaheen Shah Afridi behind in the 34th over, with the target still 65 runs away.The fine balance appeared to swing South Africa's way once again as Jansen joined Markram and the pair began to hack at the equation rather than approach it with caution, being South Africa's last pair of recognised batters. The ball after he clattered Haris Rauf back over his head for a flat six in the 37th over, Jansen spooned a slower ball to Babar Azam at point, leaving South Africa 36 away from the target with four wickets in hand.Fourteen runs later, the legspinner Usama Mir, who came into this game in the 15th over of South Africa's chase as a concussion substitute for Shadab Khan, picked up his second wicket: Markram's attempted heave resulting in a leading edge that landed in Babar's hands once again. South Africa's last recognised batter was gone with his team still 22 short.Afridi then found the outside edge of Gerald Coetzee and Rauf pulled off a one-handed diving return catch to dismiss Lungi Ngidi. By then, they had poked and prodded their way to within 11 runs of victory. On another day, umpire Alex Wharf might have upheld Rauf's lbw appeal against the No. 11 Shamsi off the final ball of the 46th over. Not tonight. Pakistan reviewed the not-out decision, only to watch in agony as the ball-tracking showed impact to be umpire's call. Nine balls later, it was all over - after 25 matches, the 2023 ODI World Cup had its first thriller. And South Africa did not choke.Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj celebrate South Africa's nail-biting win•ICC/Getty ImagesWhile South Africa's batting performance may have been jittery, their bowling effort - their weaker discipline so far in the tournament - was impressive on a flat surface.\n","\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;5;200mRetrieving text node: While they were batting it was confirmed that Shadab would not be able to take any further participation in the match and his replacement Usama was brought on in the 19th over. He made an almost immediate impact when he pinned van der Dussen on the pads with a topspinner. Van der Dussen reviewed and ball-tracking showed it was going on to clip leg stump. Seventeen deliveries later, Klaasen top-edged Wasim to Usama at deep third and South Africa were stuttering.Markram and Miller then came together to steady the chase with their attacking approach - adding 70 off 69 balls - and though South Africa stumbled again after they were separated, they did not fall short like they had done against Netherlands.Keshav MaharajTabraiz ShamsiMarco JansenAiden MarkramPakistanSouth AfricaPakistan vs South AfricaICC Cricket World CupFirdose Moonda is ESPNcricinfo's correspondent for South Africa and women's cricketLanguageEnglishWin ProbabilitySA 100%PAKSA100%50%100%PAK InningsSA InningsOver 48 • SA 271/9South Africa won by 1 wicket (with 16 balls remaining)Powered by Smart StatsMatch CoverageAll Match NewsWhy middling scores make for the best kind of ODIRunfests usually kill games as contests.

South Africa had thrown off the yoke of the choke by the barest of margins against Pakistan in Chennai to chase successfully for the first time in their World Cup 2023 campaign.The one-wicket win took them level with India on ten points at the top of the table, but ahead on net run rate, though they have played an extra game.The victory was set up by their bowlers - Tabraiz Shamsi and Marco Jansen in particular - who dismissed Pakistan for 270 in 46.4 overs despite them having been well placed at 225 for 5 in the 40th. And when Aiden Markram - who overtook Virat Kohli to become the second-highest run scorer of this World Cup during his innings of 91 - and David Miller were putting together their 70-run stand for the fifth wicket, a South African win looked comfortable. All that changed when Miller edged Shaheen Shah Afridi behind in the 34th over, with the target still 65 runs away.The fine balance appeared to swing South Africa's way once again as Jansen joined Markram and the pair began to hack at the equation rather than approach it with caution, being South Africa's last pair of recognised batters. The ball after he clattered Haris Rauf back over his head for a flat six in the 37th over, Jansen spooned a slower ball to Babar Azam at point, leaving South Africa 36 away from the target with four wickets in hand.Fourteen runs later, the legspinner Usama Mir, who came into this game in the 15th over of South Africa's chase as a concussion substitute for Shadab Khan, picked up his second wicket: Markram's attempted heave resulting in a leading edge that landed in Babar's hands once again. South Africa's last recognised batter was gone with his team still 22 short.Afridi then found the outside edge of Gerald Coetzee and Rauf pulled off a one-handed diving return catch to dismiss Lungi Ngidi. By then, they had poked and prodded their way to within 11 runs of victory. On another day, umpire Alex Wharf might have upheld Rauf's lbw appeal against the No. 11 Shamsi off the final ball of the 46th over. Not tonight. Pakistan reviewed the not-out decision, only to watch in agony as the ball-tracking showed impact to be umpire's call. Nine balls later, it was all over - after 25 matches, the 2023 ODI World Cup had its first thriller. And South Africa did not choke.Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj celebrate South Africa's nail-biting win•ICC/Getty ImagesWhile South Africa's batting performance may have been jittery, their bowling effort - their weaker discipline so far in the tournament - was impressive on a flat surface.\n","While they were batting it was confirmed that Shadab would not be able to take any further participation in the match and his replacement Usama was brought on in the 19th over. He made an almost immediate impact when he pinned van der Dussen on the pads with a topspinner. Van der Dussen reviewed and ball-tracking showed it was going on to clip leg stump. Seventeen deliveries later, Klaasen top-edged Wasim to Usama at deep third and South Africa were stuttering.Markram and Miller then came together to steady the chase with their attacking approach - adding 70 off 69 balls - and though South Africa stumbled again after they were separated, they did not fall short like they had done against Netherlands.Keshav MaharajTabraiz ShamsiMarco JansenAiden MarkramPakistanSouth AfricaPakistan vs South AfricaICC Cricket World CupFirdose Moonda is ESPNcricinfo's correspondent for South Africa and women's cricketLanguageEnglishWin ProbabilitySA 100%PAKSA100%50%100%PAK InningsSA InningsOver 48 • SA 271/9South Africa won by 1 wicket (with 16 balls remaining)Powered by Smart StatsMatch CoverageAll Match NewsWhy middling scores make for the best kind of ODIRunfests usually kill games as contests.

South Africa had thrown off the yoke of the choke by the barest of margins against Pakistan in Chennai to chase successfully for the first time in their World Cup 2023 campaign.The one-wicket win took them level with India on ten points at the top of the table, but ahead on net run rate, though they have played an extra game.The victory was set up by their bowlers - Tabraiz Shamsi and Marco Jansen in particular - who dismissed Pakistan for 270 in 46.4 overs despite them having been well placed at 225 for 5 in the 40th. And when Aiden Markram - who overtook Virat Kohli to become the second-highest run scorer of this World Cup during his innings of 91 - and David Miller were putting together their 70-run stand for the fifth wicket, a South African win looked comfortable. All that changed when Miller edged Shaheen Shah Afridi behind in the 34th over, with the target still 65 runs away.The fine balance appeared to swing South Africa's way once again as Jansen joined Markram and the pair began to hack at the equation rather than approach it with caution, being South Africa's last pair of recognised batters. The ball after he clattered Haris Rauf back over his head for a flat six in the 37th over, Jansen spooned a slower ball to Babar Azam at point, leaving South Africa 36 away from the target with four wickets in hand.Fourteen runs later, the legspinner Usama Mir, who came into this game in the 15th over of South Africa's chase as a concussion substitute for Shadab Khan, picked up his second wicket: Markram's attempted heave resulting in a leading edge that landed in Babar's hands once again. South Africa's last recognised batter was gone with his team still 22 short.Afridi then found the outside edge of Gerald Coetzee and Rauf pulled off a one-handed diving return catch to dismiss Lungi Ngidi. By then, they had poked and prodded their way to within 11 runs of victory. On another day, umpire Alex Wharf might have upheld Rauf's lbw appeal against the No. 11 Shamsi off the final ball of the 46th over. Not tonight. Pakistan reviewed the not-out decision, only to watch in agony as the ball-tracking showed impact to be umpire's call. Nine balls later, it was all over - after 25 matches, the 2023 ODI World Cup had its first thriller. And South Africa did not choke.Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj celebrate South Africa's nail-biting win•ICC/Getty ImagesWhile South Africa's batting performance may have been jittery, their bowling effort - their weaker discipline so far in the tournament - was impressive on a flat surface.\n","\u001b[0m"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/generation/configuration_utils.py:381: UserWarning: `do_sample` is set to `False`.
